2022 Advent of Code solutions, mainly used for learning Rust.  
Many part 1 answers may be missing because they were deleted to get part 2.  
To build, create a new project with `cargo new [dirname]` and then take a day and overwrite `src/main.rs` with its contents.

Notes:  
Day 13 - skipped because it looked annoying  
Day 15 - Basically a brute force solution for part 2, used merged intervals instead of a smarter algorithm.
